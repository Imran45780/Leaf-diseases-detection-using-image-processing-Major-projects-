# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection

This project focuses on building an intelligent system to detect and classify plant leaf diseases using machine learning and deep learning techniques. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the system can identify whether a leaf is healthy or affected by common plant diseases, helping farmers and researchers take preventive measures and improve crop yield.

## 🔍 Features

- 📷 Image-based disease detection from plant leaves
- 🤖 Machine Learning / Deep Learning model for classification
- 📊 High accuracy in predicting multiple types of diseases
- ⚡ Fast and efficient prediction for real-time use
- 🌱 Can be extended to different crops and datasets

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)  
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (for model building)  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data handling & visualization)  
- Streamlit / Flask (for deployment - optional)  

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses a publicly available **PlantVillage dataset** (or a custom dataset) containing labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Image Preprocessing** – Resizing, normalization, and augmentation of leaf images.  
2. **Model Training** – Training a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on labeled data.  
3. **Prediction** – The trained model classifies uploaded leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.  
4. **Deployment (Optional)** – A simple web app to allow users to upload leaf images and get predictions.  

## 🌟 Applications

- Helps **farmers** detect crop diseases early.  
- Useful for **agricultural researchers** to analyze plant health.  
- Can be integrated into **smart farming systems** (IoT + AI).
